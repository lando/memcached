# Configuration

Here are the configuration options, set to the default values, for this service. If you are unsure about where this goes or what this means, we *highly recommend* scanning the [services documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/config/services.html) to get a good handle on how the magicks work.

Also note that options, in addition to the [build steps](https://docs.lando.dev/config/services.html#build-steps) and [overrides](https://docs.lando.dev/config/services.html#overrides) that are available to every service, are shown below:

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: memcached:1
    portforward: false
    mem: 64
```

## Port forwarding

`portforward` will allow you to access this service externally by assigning a port directly on your host's `localhost`. Note that `portforward` can be set to either `true` or a specific `port` but we *highly recommend* you set it to `true` unless you have pretty good knowledge of how port assignment works or you have a **very** compelling reason for needing a locked down port.

`portforward: true` will prevent inevitable port collisions and provide greater reliability and stability across Lando apps. That said, one downside of `portforward: true` is that Docker will assign a different port every time you restart your application. You can read more about accessing services externally [over here](https://docs.lando.dev/guides/external-access.html).

`tl;dr`

**Recommended**

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: memcached
    portforward: true
```

**Not recommended**

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: memcached
    portforward: 11211
```

## Getting information

You can get connection and credential information about your memcached instance by running [`lando info`](https://docs.lando.dev/cli/info.html). It may also be worth checking out our [accessing services externally guide](https://docs.lando.dev/guides/external-access.html).
